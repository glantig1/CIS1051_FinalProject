# Submission Retrospective



I enjoyed my time developing on Ren.py, and am grateful for Prof. Rosen's suggesting it; otherwise I'd likely have half the project I have now if I stuck to TKinter. 
Though the functions I used for the puzzles were a real pain to ensure that every combination was represented, the hardest thing was probably getting the inventory menu to work and took the most research to get it to work.
I did a lot more than I initially thought i'd be able to, specifically the art. Though AI generated, I didn't even think I'd have time for that. Since I had a capstone project, I found it easy to procrastinate on that in order to work on this.
I apologize for making such a long video for the demo, but I recorded it a few dozen times and couldn't get it under 5 without making major mistakes in the recording.
