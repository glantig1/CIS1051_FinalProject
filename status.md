Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a short design diagram for the structure of the game. I have also made the menu and initial navigation for all the rooms I intend for the game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not done the investigation nor interact logic for any of the rooms, but as soon as I do one for each I'll be able to cascade complete most of the games features.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have been trying to brute force the puzzle logic on my initial attempt for one of the two puzzles. I'm likely going to scrap a majority of it and research dynamic menu's to make it far easier.
