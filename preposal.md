# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The main idea that I have for the final project is a text based adventure with a couple of outcomes based on decisions made. I've done something similar in previous projects and understand that the core concept might not be that unique nor a tes of my knowledge, so I want to use tkinter as a GUI to make the selections for the project.

The adventure would feature a selection of rooms/areas that the user would explore using a few general actions to trigger context sensitive events. The MVP for the project would be at least 3 endings (A bad, incomplete, and true ending) with 8 rooms/areas for the user to explore. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this sufficient for a final project or do I have to increase the scope at all?
