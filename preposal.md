## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The main idea that I have for the final project is a text based adventure with a couple of outcomes based on decisions made. I've done something similar in previous projects and understand that the core concept might not be that unique nor a tes of my knowledge, so I want to use tkinter as a GUI to make the selections for the project.

The adventure would feature a selection of rooms/areas that the user would explore using a few general actions to trigger context sensitive events. The MVP for the project would be at least 2 endings (A good and bad ending) with 8 rooms/areas for the user to explore. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this sufficient for a final project or do I have to increase the scope at all?



# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fort Myst

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will be a text based adventure game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

 The project will be developed in python. The game will be displayed and interacted with using the GUI TKinter.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will feature interactive buttons that display a suite of choices (in text only) based on context. Ideally the user will have an inventory which will potentially add more context options, but no matter what the story will have a set of atleast 8 rooms/locations and 2 endings depending on your choices.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be to have 3 ending (this includes the 2 initial), and increase the scope to 10 rooms (including the initial 8). The additional 2 rooms can ideally be simple puzzle (think match shapes and mix colors).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to add images, however, I am not an artist nor do I think I'll have the time considering the amount of potential paths.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The initial step would be to define the basic structure of the narrative (i.e: what is the initial state? what is the goal?). The second would be to design the interactions (what are the set of actions? what are the set of interactables in each room?). The third is to create an initial mock-up just in terminal. The final is to implement the tkinter.

I will need to research tkinter, however, there is a multitude of resource on how to use tkinter online and there are a few open source projects I can reference.
